# Stock Forecasting Using Prophet

This project demonstrates how to forecast stock prices using the **Prophet** library in Python. It includes data analysis, visualization, forecasting, and evaluation techniques, making it reusable for various stock datasets.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Insights from historical stock data.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations of price trends and volume.
- **Forecasting**: Prediction of future stock prices using Prophet.
- **Automation**: Flexible setup for analyzing other stocks.

## Project Workflow
1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - Tools like `pandas`, `plotly`, and `prophet` were used.
2. **Loading Dataset**:
   - The dataset was inspected for structure and summary statistics.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Created area, line, bar, and box plots for deeper insights.
4. **Modeling with Prophet**:
   - Prepared data and trained a forecasting model.
5. **Forecast Generation**:
   - Predicted future values with visualizations and components.
6. **Evaluation**:
   - Compared forecasted data with actual values.
7. **Automation**:
   - Developed a reusable process for other stocks.
8. **Export**:
   - Results saved and downloadable as a CSV file.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Prophet**: Time-series forecasting.
- **Plotly**: Interactive data visualization.
- **Google Sheets**: Manual validation.

## Example Visualizations
- Stock price trends over time.
- Forecast components (trend, seasonality).
- Evaluation of predicted vs actual values.

## How to Use
1. **Data Preparation**: Import the desired stock dataset.
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.
3. **Modify for Other Stocks**: Adjust data import for new stock symbols.
4. **Save Forecast**: Export predictions as CSV.
